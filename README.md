# TrinVK (Trinity Vulkan)
### What is TrinVK?
TrinVK is a C++ Game Engine passion project that is currently being developed by one person. 

I plan to implement multiple languages mainly easy ones to make game development more beginner friendly.

I also was making a C++ game engine in OpenGL but found it conflicting since I felt like having preformance pushed out as much as possible while having a lot of cross platform support
was one of my big goals and OpenGL didn't satisfy those needs.

### Why Vulkan?
The benefits of Vulkan is that it has pretty good preformance and cross platform features, as well as being pretty good at supporting and being able to handle pretty expensive graphics
calculations.

### A side note for Vulkan..
Whilst Vulkan is really good for modern game engines and graphics, the boilerplate is ***excessive*** for a single person, so much to the point where it gets really confusing to 
navigate/write. So while I am writing a lot of the main Vulkan code, there are parts of the Vulkan system like rendering that is being written with the help of artificial intelligence.
